# LTweaksMAGI

## Instruction

* A lightweight Magisk module. My little tweaks for some Android apps and system.

* If you used [LTweaks](https://github.com/bluesky139/LTweaks) many years ago, you may know what this is.

* [LTweaks](https://github.com/bluesky139/LTweaks) -> [LTweaksSystem](https://github.com/bluesky139/LTweaksSystem) -> [LTweaksMAGI](https://github.com/bluesky139/LTweaksMAGI)

* A very quick way to know what this module can do, see [strings.xml](https://github.com/bluesky139/LTweaksMAGI/blob/master/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml).

* Not like before, I'm very lazy these years, don't expect me to do many things that what you want, do-it-yourselfery.

* Android 12 only, better AOSP or AOSP-like system.

## Build

* Open this project in Android Studio, and make sure your phone is connected.

* Build release app and install.
